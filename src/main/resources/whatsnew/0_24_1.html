  <h1>The future of committing in IntelliJ IDEA</h1>
  <p>
    I've avoided What's New content for a long time, both because I didn't have the time to write
    and because there was nothing really worthy of announcing.
    <br>
    However, today is a special occasion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of you might have already noticed it, most not yet probably, but the <strong>modal commit workflow</strong>
    is <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-177161">getting removed</a> starting from <strong>2025.1</strong> -
    in favor of the <strong>non-modal</strong> alternative.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've invested quite some time on improving my commit experience, and I've always loved the focused approach
    of IDEA's commit dialog. Its UI widgets are positioned in the perfect way to carefully examine the commit's changeset,
    while also visualizing the commit's message.
    <br>
    That doesn't apply to the non-modal alternative: by default a small portion of a toolwindow is dedicated to the
    commit message, totally separated from the rest of the context. Is committing a secondary activity now, and not
    what we most frequently do during the day? Don't we deserve a tailored experience based on preference?
  </p>
  <p>
    To be clear, I've investigated every possible option that is available for the non-modal workflow,
    and the result has always been subpar compared to the modal dialog. It's just not the proper way in my opinion.
  </p>
  <h1>Why non-modal?</h1>
  <p>
    Good question.
    <br>
    The reality is IDEA as a platform has always <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-43713">suffered</a>
    from modality issues. Plus we now have remote development, which apparently doesn't work well with modal dialogs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stated reasons are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance & overall experience</strong>
      <br>
      Honestly no idea what that means. The dialog doesn't have any sort of performance impact.
      I've played around with every class related to that dialog so it's not that I'm writing random words.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Remote development</strong>
      <br>
      I'm a paying customer, and I'd like to keep enjoying the experience I've been used to for 10 years
      at this point. Remote development is a separate use case, and it's the use case that should be
      adapted to the workflow, not the other way around.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>The cherry on top</h1>
  <p>
    I'm not done yet, because they've actually <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-177749">removed</a>
    a second feature!
    <br>
    The <a href="https://github.com/lppedd/idea-conventional-commit/blob/master/images/cc_filters.png">dropdown menu</a>
    that you could open from the completion popup to adjust how completion works has now been removed.
    No idea why, was it yet another maintenance effort that isn't affordable anymore?
  </p>
  <h1>Closing remarks</h1>
  <p>
    I'm not here to tell you what JetBrains is doing is <i>wrong</i>, I'm here to tell you what JetBrains
    hasn't told you - for some reason. Was it too difficult to first publish a blog post?
    Instead, the change has been done behind a private YouTrack issue with no input from paying customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We got lucky they decided to - at least - extract the modal dialog into a plugin, much like the Classic UI.
    But we know very well what that means.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, now that you're aware of what's happening feel free to leave a comment on the referenced issues,
    or to simply ignore this message if you don't see any problem with those changes.
